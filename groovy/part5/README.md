# Goals
Now that we have the application broken down into some discrete parts, we are in a good position to add the new options (lizard, spock)

#### Considerations
- Introduce new options (spock,lizard)


#### Changes
  - Move `OptionFactory` to static property
  - Refactor options prompt into `availableOptions()` method

#### Next Steps
  - More pushing to the edges
